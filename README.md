# polynomial_regression_from_scratch
A jupyter project that contains an implementation of polynomial regression through custom functions implemented in python numpy. It is not regularized and shows how unregularized models may overfit, especially with polynomial regression which tends to bend and curve trying to reach every data point in the training data.
